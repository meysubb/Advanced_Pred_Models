    "# Question 1 - Bias-variance Trandeoff (2pts)\n",
    "How does the choice of K in the K-nearest neighbor classifier reflect a bias-variance tradeoff?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "A low choice of K would reflect high variance and low bias. For example, a choice of K=1 would almost certainly overfit the data - the model would try to fit to each point and therefore we could also be incorporating a lot of noise from the data. Bias would be low since the average difference between estimated and true values is not skewed since every point is considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparatively, a high choice of K would reflect low variance and high bias. In this case, we would likely be underfitting the data."

    "1. NBC has come up with an extreme TV show, and each of its viewers either likes or hates it. (no middle ground here; we are in a “black and white age”). NBC wants to estimate what fraction p of its audience like the show by “randomly” calling n viewers and tallying their responses so as to estimate the true value of p to a fractional accuracy of within ±ε%, with a confidence of (1 − α) × 100%. For α = 0.10, ε = 0.03 (i.e. your answer will be $\\hat{p}$ ± 0.02), what is the minimum value of n needed if true value (i) p = 0.5, (ii) p=0.25? \n",
