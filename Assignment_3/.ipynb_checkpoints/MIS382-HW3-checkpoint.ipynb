    "1. Using stochastic gradient descent, derive the coefficent updates for all 4 coefficients of the model: $$ y = w_0 + w_1*x_1 + w_2*x_1*x_2 + w_3*x_2 $$ Hint: start from the cost function (Assume sum of squared error). If you write the math by hand, submit that as a separate file and make a reference to it in your notebook or include the image in your notebook.\n",
    "2. Write Python code for an SGD solution to the non-linear model $$ y = w_0 + w_1*x_1 + w_2*x_1*x_2 + w_3*x_2$$ Try to format similarly to scikit-learn's models. Your class should take as input the learning_rate, regularization_constant and number of epochs. The fit method must take as input X,y and a choice of update_rule as 'SGD' or 'adagrad' (Notes on implementation below). The _predict_ method takes an X value (optionally, an array of values). Use your new gradient descent regression to predict the data given in 'samples.csv', for 10 epochs, using learning rates: [.0001, .001, .01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100] and regularization constants in the range: [0,10,100] . Plot MSE and the $w$ parameters as a function of epoch count (10 epochs) for the best 2 combinations of learning_rate and regularization for both SGD and Adagrad. ie you should have 2 plots of MSE and parameter updates for SGD and adagrad each. Report the MSE at the end of 10 epochs for all 4 combinations.\n",

    "# Notes on Adagrad\n",
    "Adagrad (http://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/) differs from vanilla SGD in that the learning rate of each weight changes over updates. A cache is maintained that holds the sum of squares of all gradients upto the current update. The learning_rate is divided by the cache, resulting in a different learning rate for each weight. A consequence of this update rule is that weights that have already seen large gradients (made large jumps) make smaller updates in subsequent iterations.\n",
    "Specifically, the steps can be listed as below:\n",

A great advantage of this is the removal of the necessity to dial in the desired learning rate. Adagrad manages the tweaking of learning rates automatically as the model iterates. This could allow for a more accurate model identified faster, as each weight is able to learn at its independent optimal learning rate."

    "30,10 hidden layers underperformed for the k-folds cross-validation method. All methods were higher on RMSE for this method compared to the full data set, but 30,10 was uncharacteristically higher for this method. The higher quantity of hidden layers proved effective at minimizing errors; and higher iterations of epochs continued to reduce error. These findings are in line with expected results.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Rate of accuracy increase decreased as epochs continued to high iterations. This corresponds to expected slowing of change in error as accuracy increases. For the 100 hidden layer size model, there appears to be an uptick of error as the model passed 50 epochs. This could be most likely attributed to overfitting of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "When learning rates were alterd, expected changes in ultimate RMSE were about expected. The obscenely high Learning Rate of 1 gave the equally obscenely high RMSE due to the model overshooting the corretions by substantial amounts. Lower values of learning rates are much more benefitial."

    "b. Suppose you want to learn a binary classifier to predict whether or not a customer will buy a TV. The class label is 0 if the customer does not buy a TV and 1 if they do. For each customer, you are given two features, $x_1$ is the per hour salary and $x_2$ is the age. Assume that the class conditional distribution $p([x_1 , x_2]|C)$ is Gaussian. The mean salary and age of the people who do buy a TV is 15 and 30 respectively and that of those who don’t is 8.5 and 25. Assume that both classes of customers have the same covariance given by the Identity matrix. Further, your sales data suggests that only 1 in 3 people actually bought a TV in the last few years. Mathematically derive the (optimal) Bayes decision boundary for this problem. (5 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Now write code to sample 100 customers from each class (C = 0, 1) under the assumed distribution and the estimated parameters and plot their features. Additionally, plot the decision boundary you obtained in the part (b) on the same plot. (3 points)\n",

Using the class tree.DecisionTreeClassifier (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.tree), build two different trees with a maximum depth of two using the split criteria (i) Gini and (ii) Entropy.

    "These decision trees allow for the classification of patients based upon class-conditional likelihood based upon results of common tests performed on breast tissues. This provides a very easy to follow system for classification of patients that medical staff and patients would both understand. These models are very simple, based upon only two cuts each, which may not provide the best accuracy but can be followed with minimal risk of misclassification. With the classification determined, medical staff can initiate any procedures as necessary based upon results."
